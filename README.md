### The Sketch of the Mirror is fairly basic in idea. A Mirror with the User being the Central peice. On the left Would be the date, weather, & the events for the day. on the left is the users health, such as weight, excersice, etc. And on the bottom is the socail tabs, being the news, twitter feed, & texts.

### The Final Mirror doesnt neccesarily stay true to the sketch's plan. I made a majority of the focus on the day's events, via calendar activities, weather, & news. 

### I expanded upon the Weather to show not just the temp, but the feels like, High & Low, Humidity & Wind Speed. I also made it so that the only health focus would be on your weight.
### Finally I made the social tab exclusively News, as twitter was difficult to read & Texts were better utilized over phone.

### For advanced features I have a changable light that is used by voice commands. This way users can change the light to improve visibilty depending on wether they are color blind & what kind. as well as allow them to change the color without needing to touch the mirrir which prevents smudges and dirt.

### There are also two more minor features, if the user says Intruder Alert, the lights will change to a Bright warning Red, a text will play & some audio will cue.
If the User Says "Mirror Mirror on the wall, who is the most beutiful of them all? A fun little Easter egg will appear."

## All modes can be reset by saying Default
